# Browser Filetransfer
### About
Tranfer files between two computers using browser. Built using webrtc samples from (https://webrtc.github.io/samples/)[Webrtc samples].

This project will not contain a way of signalling between the two machines. Communicate the `sdp messages` using whatsapp, or any other chat.

### Future
1. Planning to make this tool usable even without internet, if you'd like to tranfer files between two computers on the same network. We can be paranoid at times. You'll need a connection between the two computers of course, perhaps router without external ethernet cable?
2. Not interested in making it more complicated and good looking, barebones and just enough code to make it work securely.
